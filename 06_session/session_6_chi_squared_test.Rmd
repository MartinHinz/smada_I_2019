## Repetition: Statistical hypothesis testing

### Validation of an assumption about the population

A assumption (hypothesis) about the population is made and than its probability is checked against the sample.

### Usual questions:

**How probable is it that two or more samples descend from the different/the same population?**

(eg. Is the custom of grave goods for man and women so different that two different social groups are visible?)

.right[*Two samples, Test for independence*]

**How probable is it that a given sample descend from a population with certain parameters?**

(Is the amount of grave goods random or is a pattern visible?)

.right[*One sample, Goodness-of-fit-Test*]

---

## Repetition: Nonparametric tests

### Parametric vs. nonparametric

**Parametric**: The distribution of the values have to be in a certain form (e.g. normal distribution); assumptions about the distribution of the population are needed

**non-parametric**: no assumptions about the distribution of the sample and the population are needed

### Nonparametric tests, advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantage**: Also appropriate if no statements about the distribution are possible or the distribution fits no for parametric tests.

Also smaller samples are possible.

**Disadvantages**: Tests have general a lesser power.

## $\chi^2$ test

]

---

## $\chi^2$ test [1]


### Possible Questions

**Do settlements tend to be situated on rather good soil or is the distribution random?**

Conclusions about settlement behaviour and economy would be possible

**Do older individuals have more shoe-last celt as grave goods than younger?**

If shoe-last celt would be signs of social rank than this situation would make conclusions possible about heredity or acquisition of social rank during life time.

**Tests for nominal scaled variables are possible!**

Therefore of particular value for archaeology because we have often to deal with such data.

---

## $\chi^2$ test [2]

### Test for independence of two distributions

**Requirements**: at least 1 nominal scaled variable (one sample case) and
1 nominal scaled grouping variable (two sample case)

**Procedure with one sample**: observed values are compared with expected values given a certain distribution, no expected value should be < 5; n should be > 50

**Procedure with two samples**: observed values of both distributions are
compared with expected values if the samples would be even distributed,
no expected value should be < 5; n should be > 50

**Test statistics**: $\chi^2$

Significance depend on degree of freedom (df)

## $\chi^2$ test [3]

### Test for one sample (example after Shennan)

Numbers of neolithic settlements by soil type in eastern france

| Soil type | Number of settlements |
| - |-|
| Rendzina | 26 |
| Alluvial | 9 |
| Brown earth | 18 |
| total | 53 |

Question: Is there a significant preference for a soil type?

We calculate two versions:

*1. even distributed*

*2. even distributed with consideration of the proportion of the soil types on the total area*

---

## $\chi^2$ test [4]

### Version 1: even distributed

| Soil type | Number of settlements | Proportion of soil type | expected number of settlements |
| - |-| - | - |
| Rendzina | 26 | 1/3 | 17.6667 |
| Alluvial | 9 | 1/3 | 17.6667 |
| Brown earth | 18 | 1/3 | 17.6667 |
| total | 53 | 1 | 53 |


$H_0$: The settlements are evenly distributed on all soil types.

$H_1$: The settlements are **not** evenly distributed on all soil types.

---

## $\chi^2$ test [5]

### Version 1: even distributed

| Soil type | Number of settlements | Proportion of soil type | expected number of settlements |
| - |-| - | - |
| Rendzina | 26 | 1/3 | 17.6667 |
| Alluvial | 9 | 1/3 | 17.6667 |
| Brown earth | 18 | 1/3 | 17.6667 |
| total | 53 | 1 | 53 |

Formula for $\chi^2$:

$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

$O_i$: number of **observed** cases

$E_i$: number of **expected** cases

$\chi^2$: symbol for the test statistic chi-squared

---

## $\chi^2$ test [6]

**Procedure: Calculation of the Χ²-value**

$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

| Soil type | Number of observed cases | Number of expected cases | $O_i - E_i$ | $(O_i - E_i)^2$ | $\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$ |
| - |-| - | - |
| Rendzina | 26 | 17.6667 | 8.3333 | 69,4444 | 3.9308 |
| Alluvial | 9 | 17.6667 | -8.6667 | 75,1117 | 4.2516 |
| Brown earth | 18 | 17.6667 | 0.3333 | 0.1111 | 0.0063 |
| total | 53 | 53 | | | **8.18868** |

**Look up in a table (e.g. Shennan):**
Df=2 (2 colums (expected, observed), 3 categories)

Level of significance: 0.05

Boundary value: 5.99145

**Significant result: The distribution is uneven!**

---

## $\chi^2$ test [7]

### Version 2: even distributed with consideration of the proportion of the soil types on the total area

| Soil type | Number of settlements | Proportion of soil type | expected number of settlements |
| - |-| - | - |
| Rendzina | 26 | 32% | 16.69 |
| Alluvial | 9 | 25% | 13.25 |
| Brown earth | 18 | 34% | 22.79 |
| total | 53 | 1 | 53 |

$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

---
## $\chi^2$ test [8]

**Procedure: Calculation of the Χ²-value**

$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

| Soil type | Number of observed cases | Number of expected cases | $O_i - E_i$ | $(O_i - E_i)^2$ | $\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$ |
| - |-| - | - |
| Rendzina | 26 | 16.69 | 9.04 | 81.7216 | 4.8185 |
| Alluvial | 9 | 13.25 | -4.25 | 18.0625 | 1.1363 |
| Brown earth | 18 | 22.79 | -4.79 | 22.9441 | 1.007 |
| total | 53 | 53 | | | **7.1885** |

**Look up in a table (e.g. Shennan):**
Df=2 (2 colums (expected, observed), 3 categories)

Level of significance: 0.05

Boundary value: 5.99145

**Significant result: The distribution is uneven also if we consider the proportions of the soil types!**

## $\chi^2$ test [10]

### Two sample case (Test for independence)

*(example after Hinz, beautified)*

Comparison of amber in graves and settlements

Classic 2x2 situation

| Type of site | amber || total |
| - | - | - | - |
| | + | - | |
| settlement | 6 | 18 | 24 |
| grave | 132 | 44 | 176 |
| total | 138 | 62 | 200 |

**Is amber primary a grave good?**

df=1

Level of significance = 0.05

---

## $\chi^2$ test [11]

### Procedure: Calculation of the expected values

Multiply the margins and divide the result by the total number

| Type of site | amber || total |
| - | - | - | - |
| | + | - | |
| settlement | 24*138/200 = 16.56 | 24*62/200=7.44 | 24 |
| grave | 138*176/200=121.44 | 62*176/200=54,56 | 176 |
| total | 138 | 62 | 200 |

---

## $\chi^2$ test [12]

### Procedure: Calculation of the expected values

Multiply the margins and divide the result by the total number

| Type of site | amber || total |
| - | - | - | - |
| | + | - | |
| settlement | O=6 vs. E=16.56 | O=18 vs. E=7.44 | 24 |
| grave | O=132 vs. E=121.44 | O=44 vs. E=54.56 | 176 |
| total | 138 | 62 | 200 |

$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

---

## $\chi^2$ test [13]

### Procedure: Calculation of the expected values

$\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

| Type of site | amber || total |
| - | - | - | - |
| | + | - | |
| settlement | (6-16.56)^2/16.56=6.73 | (18-7.44)^2/7.44=14.99 | 24 |
| grave | (132-121.44)^2/121.44=0.92 | (44-54.56)^2/54.56=2.04 | 176 |
| total | 138 | 62 | 200 |

**Is amber primary a grave good?**

Df=1, Level of significance = 0.05;

$\chi^2$=24,68; boundary value (df=1 and p=0.05): 3.84146

The difference in the distribution is significantly not by chance. Both variables are associated!

---

## $\chi^2$ test [14]

```{r}
amber<-matrix(c(6,132,18,44),ncol=2)
colnames(amber)<-c("with amber","without amber")
rownames(amber)<-c("settlement","grave")
amber
chisq.test(amber)
```

---

## $\chi^2$ test [15]

```{r}
chisq.test(amber)
chisq.test(amber,correct=F)
```

Correct: Yates correction for small samples → (|O-E|-0,5)²/E

## Measurement of association [1]

### Measurement of the strength of the association of two variables

$\chi^2$ is already a Measurment of association:

Association ↑ $\chi^2$ ↑ ↔ Association ↓ $\chi^2$ ↓

But: $\chi^2$ depends on n

## Fishers Test [1]

Problem with to low expected values

## Fishers Test excercise

### Boar teeth in globular amphora graves (Müller 2001, numbers changed)

Given are the following numbers

| sex | Boar teeth ||
| - | - | - |
| | + | - |
| male | 11 | 7 |
| female | 1 | 6 |

Analyse if there is a significant association!

---

## Interpretation of Tests

### Statistical association not mean causal association!

Example after Shennan: Grave size and sex

Although there is a statistically significant association between grave size and sex this could be caused by a third factor (here height)

A conclusion which says that grave size are determined by sex would be wrong!
